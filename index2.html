<!--i'm going to preface this by stating: i'm not of the habit of using styling elements such as bold or italic when i have access to CSS. 
    In fact, i tend to forget those elements are an option when i know i can use CSS to style text later with "font-weight" or "text-decoration" anyway.
    So i will be foregoing the use of those particular elements-->

                <!--is there a better way to format this in the future? i know how to use :hover in CSS but so far i have been unable to get the text to highlight unless my mouse was directly on it, however on the example site, the text changes when the mouse is touching the surrounding area. 
                is it a CSS issue or HTML issue. if it's CSS you can disregard this question since it's not relevant-->
